# Required Skills & Knowledge for Troy VEX Robotics

## 🛠 Web Development Fundamentals
- **Modern HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.
- **Advanced CSS3**: 
  - CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for theme management.
  - Flexbox and CSS Grid for complex, responsive layouts.
  - CSS Transitions and Keyframe Animations for micro-interactions.
  - Glassmorphism techniques (`backdrop-filter`, semi-transparent borders).
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event listeners, and local storage (used for dark mode persistence).

## 📱 Responsive Web Design (RWD)
- **Fluid Layouts**: Using `%`, `fr`, and `clamp()` instead of fixed widths.
- **Media Queries**: Targeting mobile (`< 768px`), tablet (`768px - 1024px`), and desktop.
- **Mobile-First Workflow**: Prioritizing the mobile experience during design.
- **Touch Optimization**: Ensuring clickable elements have appropriate tap targets and cursors.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Using font weights, sizes, and colors to guide the user's eye.
- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Maintaining color contrast and accessibility in both light and dark themes.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Avoiding clutter, placeholder images, and generic styles.
- **Consistent Branding**: Enforcing the choice of 'Geist' for sans-serif components and 'Georgia/Playfair' for serif headers.

## 🚢 Deployment & Environment
- **Local Development**: Using `http-server` for previewing static assets.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Understanding the project's hosting environment via `vercel.json`.
- **Version Control**: Best practices for file naming and organization to prevent asset breakage.

## 🤝 Project Context
- **VEX Robotics Ecosystem**: Understanding the distinction between Signature Events, Regionals, and the World Championship.
- **JROTC Values**: Respecting the military-academic character of the program in copy and design decisions.
